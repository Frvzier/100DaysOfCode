# 100 Days Of Code Challenge 
![alt text](http://www.finaldraftdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/100DaysofCode_1200x500.jpg)


**Main Goal:** ***Code every day for the next 100 days for at least an hour a day.***

The goal of this challenge is to code for at least an hour each day. In the official rules created by Alexander Kallaway, tutorials and coursework projects are to not be counted...

...however, being a self-taught aspiring developer that would be a little tough for me.

So, I decided to add my little twist to the rule book.

I will code for an hour each day, if I'm viewing a tutorial, I will take what I have learned and either create something from what I learned or recreate the project in my own way, adding new features.

I will document everything that I have worked on each day in the log md.
