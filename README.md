# 100 Days Of Code Challenge 
![alt text](http://www.finaldraftdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/100DaysofCode_1200x500.jpg)

The goal of this challenge is to code for at least an hour each day. In the official rules created by Alexander Kallaway, tutorials and coursework projects are to not be counted...

...however, being a self-taught aspiring developer that would be a little tough for me. 

So, I decided to add my little twist to the rule book.

- I will code for an hour each day, if I'm viewing a tutorial, I will take what I've learned and recreate the project in my own way, adding new features.

- I will document everything that I've worked on each day in the log md.

I hope many other aspiring developers will someday see this repo and start the challenge yourself.

Happy Coding!!
